🌐 Linux VM Home Lab with Docker, Tailscale, NGINX, and Nextcloud

This project sets up a fully self-hosted personal cloud environment inside an Ubuntu virtual machine. It demonstrates secure remote access, container orchestration, reverse proxying, and private cloud hosting using modern DevOps tools.

Features

Ubuntu Linux VM as the base operating system

Docker containers for Tailscale, NGINX, and Nextcloud

Tailscale mesh VPN for secure remote access without exposing your home network

NGINX reverse proxy with TLS termination for secure HTTPS access

Nextcloud personal cloud server for file storage and collaboration
